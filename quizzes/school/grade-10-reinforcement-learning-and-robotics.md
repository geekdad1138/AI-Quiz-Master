- C) Teaching a computer facts
- D) Making something stronger

---

### Question 2
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: medium

**A reward signal tells an RL agent how well it's doing.**

---

### Question 3
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: medium

**What is an "agent" in reinforcement learning?**

- A) A human controlling the system
- B) An AI entity that takes actions and learns from rewards
- C) A computer server
- D) A video game character

---

### Question 4
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: medium

---

### Question 5
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in RL?**

- A) Traveling to new places vs. staying home
- B) Trying new actions (explore) vs. using known good actions (exploit)
- C) Building things vs. using them
- D) Teaching vs. learning

---

### Question 6
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Policy gradients are a type of RL algorithm that directly learns a policy (action selection strategy).**

---

### Question 7
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is a state in reinforcement learning?**

- A) A feeling or emotion
- B) The current configuration of the environment that the agent perceives
- C) A location on a map
- D) A status message

---

### Question 8
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Deep reinforcement learning combines deep neural networks with RL to handle complex problems.**

---

### Question 9
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is the Bellman equation in reinforcement learning?**

- A) An equation for probability
- B) A recursive equation that relates the value of a state to the values of successor states
- C) An equation for neural networks
- D) An equation for game theory

---

### Question 10
**Type**: true-false

---

### Question 11
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is a major challenge in applying RL to real-world robotics?**
