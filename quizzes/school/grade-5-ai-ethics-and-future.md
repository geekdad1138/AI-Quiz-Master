### Question 8
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Environmental impact is a concern with AI because training AI systems uses lots of electricity.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

Training large AI systems requires enormous amounts of computing power, which uses electricity. This can have environmental impacts. As AI grows, we need to think about making it more efficient and using clean energy.

### Question 9
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is "algorithmic bias"?**

**Difficulty**: hard

**International cooperation is important in AI development and regulation.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

AI affects people around the world. Different countries need to work together to set standards, share best practices, and make sure AI is developed responsibly. No single country should control AI development alone.
