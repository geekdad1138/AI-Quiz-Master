## Questions

### Question 1
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is a large language model (LLM)?**

- A) A dictionary in digital form
- B) A neural network trained on massive amounts of text that can understand and generate language
- C) A database of language rules
- D) A translation tool

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**

LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA are neural networks trained on billions of text tokens. They've learned patterns about language, facts, reasoning, and coding. They can perform diverse tasks from writing to mathematical reasoning, though with limitations.

### Question 2
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Large language models truly understand language the way humans do.**

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**

This is debated, but most researchers argue LLMs don't understand like humans. They recognize statistical patterns without consciousness or true comprehension. They can seem smart but can make fundamental logical errors or confidently state falsehoods.

### Question 3
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is "hallucination" in large language models?**

- A) Experiencing visions
- B) Generating confident but false or nonsensical information
- C) Creating vivid imagination
- D) Dreaming while processing data

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**

Hallucination is when an LLM generates plausible-sounding but false information. It might invent citations, create fake facts, or produce nonsense while sounding confident. This is a major limitation of current LLMs for fact-based tasks.

### Question 4
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Multimodal AI systems can process and generate multiple types of data like text, images, and audio.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

Multimodal models like GPT-4V, CLIP, and others can handle multiple modalities. They can describe images, answer questions about pictures, generate images from descriptions, and combine text with visual information.

### Question 5
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is the "scaling hypothesis" in AI research?**

- A) Making AI systems bigger
- B) The idea that increasing model and data size leads to improved capabilities and emergent abilities
- C) Adjusting parameters up or down
- D) Growing a company's AI division

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**

The scaling hypothesis suggests that larger models trained on more data develop better capabilities. Empirically, this has held true - larger models often solve harder problems and develop surprising new abilities. It's driven AI progress but has limits.

### Question 6
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Few-shot learning allows models to learn from just a few examples without retraining.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

Few-shot learning is when a model adapts to new tasks with just a few examples in the prompt. For instance, showing an LLM two examples of a new task lets it perform similarly on new data. This is a key capability of large models.

### Question 7
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is the problem of AI interpretability?**

- A) Understanding how AI systems make decisions
- B) No problem, AI is easy to understand
- C) Making AI faster
- D) Teaching AI to be more intelligent

**Correct Answer**: A

**Explanation**

AI interpretability is about understanding why AI systems make specific decisions. Deep learning models are often "black boxes" - we can see inputs and outputs but not the internal reasoning. This is critical for high-stakes decisions like medical diagnosis or legal judgments.

---

### Question 8
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**AI systems trained on historical data may perpetuate and amplify historical biases.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

If AI is trained on biased historical data (e.g., hiring data from discriminatory practices), it will learn and perpetuate those biases. The system might discriminate against protected groups. Understanding and mitigating bias requires careful data curation and testing.

---

### Question 9
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is the alignment problem in AI?**

- A) Making sure computers are aligned physically
- B) Ensuring AI systems behave in ways humans intend and value
- C) Aligning data files
- D) Matching AI with human schedules

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**

The alignment problem asks: how do we ensure powerful AI systems do what we want? Even if an AI is capable, it must pursue goals aligned with human values. This is a major research area, especially for advanced AI systems.

---

### Question 10
**Type**: true-false
**Difficulty**: hard

**Explainable AI (XAI) techniques help make AI decisions more transparent and understandable.**

**Correct Answer**: True

**Explanation**

XAI encompasses techniques to make AI decisions interpretable. Methods include attention visualization, feature importance analysis, and generating explanations. Better explainability builds trust and enables accountability.

### Question 11
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What role might AI play in scientific discovery?**

- A) None, science is purely human
- B) Accelerating research through data analysis, hypothesis generation, and simulation
- C) Replacing all scientists
- D) Only analyzing existing data

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**

AI is already helping scientists. AI systems can analyze vast datasets, suggest hypotheses, run simulations, and design experiments. AI is becoming a collaborative tool in physics, biology, chemistry, and other fields, accelerating discovery.

### Question 12
**Type**: multiple-choice
**Difficulty**: hard

**What is crucial for responsible AI development?**

- A) Speed of development only
- B) Capability without regard for consequences
- C) Interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical review, transparency, testing, and regulatory frameworks
- D) No regulation needed

**Correct Answer**: C

**Explanation**

Responsible AI requires collaboration between computer scientists, ethicists, social scientists, and policymakers. It needs technical testing, ethical review, transparency about limitations, and appropriate regulations. Single-discipline approaches are insufficient.
